PyBooklet
=========

A GUI utility to convert a PDF file into 2 Pages-Per-Sheet double-sided booklet ready for printing.


THE IDEA:
=========

I needed to print a large pdf about starting QT programming and I couldn't find out how to make the print double-sided with 2 pages per sheet, so I made this tool ... with Python and QT.
